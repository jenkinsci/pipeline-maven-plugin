  Select a maven settings element from the available providers.

  The settings element in the <code>settings.xml</code> file contains elements used
  to define values which configure Maven execution in various ways, like the <code>pom.xml</code>,
  but should not be bundled to any specific project, or distributed to an audience.
  These include values such as the local repository location, alternate remote repository servers,
  and authentication information.
