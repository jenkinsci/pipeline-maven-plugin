        Type of version, "release" or "snapshot", of the Maven dependencies tracked to trigger this pipeline.
        For example, it may not be desired to trigger this pipeline if a released dependency has changed.
        <br/>
        Excluding "release" dependencies is an optimization to reduce the size of the database of the
        graph of jobs and maven artifacts. Will become less important when the pipeline-maven-plugin will
        be able to store data in an external database instead of the embedded H2 database.
