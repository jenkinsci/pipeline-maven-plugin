    Publish Open Task Scanner reports.<br/>

    Open Task Scanner reports are by default published if the
    <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Task+Scanner+Plugin">Jenkins Task Scanner Plugin</a> is installed.<br/>

    The default setup is to look in Java source code for "<code>FIXME</code>" comments as high priority tasks
    and for "<code>TODO</code>" comments as normal priority tasks.
