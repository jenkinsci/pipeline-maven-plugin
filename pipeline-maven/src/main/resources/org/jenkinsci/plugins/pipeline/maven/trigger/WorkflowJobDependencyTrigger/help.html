  Trigger the build of this pipeline when a Maven SNAPSHOT dependency is built by this Jenkins instance.

  Jenkins discovers all the dependencies of the Maven builds of this pipeline invoked in a <code>withMaven(){...}</code> wrapping step and
  will trigger the build if one of these dependencies has been built (typically a SNAPSHOT version).

  This is convenient for automatically performing continuous integration. Jenkins will check the snapshot dependencies from the <code>&lt;dependency&gt;</code> element in the POM.
