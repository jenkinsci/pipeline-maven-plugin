        <strong>Skip Downstream Triggers</strong>: Don't trigger dependent pipelines if a maven artifact declared in the withMaven block has changed,
        even if those pipelines have registered a trigger on SNAPSHOT dependencies changes.<br/>
        This flag is convenient to prevent storms of pipeline builds when modifying a widely mutualized maven artifact.

        <strong>Ignore Upstream Triggers</strong>: Don't trigger this pipeline if a maven dependency has changed by its own pipeline,
        even if this pipeline has registered a trigger on SNAPSHOT dependencies changes.
