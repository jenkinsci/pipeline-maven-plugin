        Threshold to trigger downstream pipelines based on the <a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html">Maven lifecycle</a>
        phase successfully reached during the Maven execution.
    </p>
    <p>
        If "install" is selected then downstream pipelines will be triggered for "<code>mvn clean install</code>", "<code>mvn clean deploy</code>"
        but NOT "<code>mvn clean verify</code>" or "<code>mvn clean package</code>".
    </p>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Configure a Jenkins Multibranch Pipeline with
    <ul>
        <li>Threshold: "<code>deploy</code>"</li>
        <li>execution of "<code>mvn clean deploy</code>" on branches (incl. master) and execution of "<code>mvn clean
            verify</code> on pull requests</li>
    </ul>
    So that:
    <ul>
        <li>The builds of branches (incl. "master") would upload the generated jar/war file to your enterprise Maven repository and would trigger downstream pipelines</li>
        <li>The builds of pull request would only build the package but NOT upload the generated jar/war file to your enterprise Maven repository and would NOT trigger downstream pipelines</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
